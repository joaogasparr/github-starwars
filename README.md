## :rocket: Getting Started

The following instructions show how the concrete solutions challenge should be executed.

### Prerequisites

- [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- [Get a Single User](https://api.github.com/users/:username)
- [List User Repositories](https://api.github.com/users/:username/repos)

### Layout

Shared layout via [Zeplin.io](https://zpl.io/VxYQp7g)

```
# User
$> desafio_concrete

# Password
$> challengeaccepted

```

### Navigation

```
● When searching for a user through github login, direct to result screen search

● If user is found present user details page (Layout result), otherwise display friendly message (Layout NotFound)
```

### Requirements

```
● I as a user wish to search for a GitHub user

● I, as a user, want to see the details of this searched user (number of followers, number of followed, avatar image, email and bio)

● I, as a user, want to see the listing of this user's repositories that was fetched
```

### Definition of done

```
● The layout must be implemented according to the Zeplin.io specification.

● A framework is not required, but we recommend React.js

● The use of routes is required.
```
